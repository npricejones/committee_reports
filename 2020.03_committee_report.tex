    \section*{Committee Report}


	My thesis assessing the feasibility of chemical tagging in the Milky Way is coming to a close. I have focused my efforts on the Apache Point Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE - \citealt{Majewski2017}). Over the course of my degree, I have measured the dimensionality of APOGEE's chemical space \citep{Price-Jones2018}, performed a test of chemically tagging simulated clusters in that space \citep{Price-Jones2019}, and finally applied chemical tagging to APOGEE observations. I am aiming to submit my final publication at the end of March 2020.

    \subsection*{Degree progress}
    
    Over the last five months, I have finalized my draft of a paper summarizing my results of applying chemical tagging on APOGEE abundances. This draft includes not only the groups I identified with chemical tagging, but also N-body simulations to reproduce the spread in orbital actions observed within each group. The members of each group are spread across the Milky Way.

    \subsection*{Upcoming work and anticipated challenges}
    
    At this point, the final tasks of my PhD lie ahead of me. My defense date has been set for July 10, 2020. From the time of writing, I have two months to compile my thesis and submit to external examiner Charlie Conroy (deadline: May 10, 2020). I will also need to submit my final paper on applications of chemical tagging to APOGEE and deal with any potential referee comments.

	\subsection*{Post graduation plan}
	
	As has been discussed in several meetings, I do not plan to continue along an academic career path. Over the past few months, I have been working on crafting an industry-appropriate resume and developing a personal website to showcase my expertise. I have also been working on updating my LinkedIn profile page, and have created accounts on Monster, Indeed, and ZipRecruiter. I have spoken to several graduates of the astronomy PhD now pursuing careers in industry about the various merits of the Insight Fellowship program and the Lantern Institute as preparatory techniques for a data science career.

\section*{Timeline}

This version of the timeline is modified from the original appearing in the thesis proposal. 

\subsection*{Detailed upcoming timeline}
Color-coding is as follows:
    
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item {\color{RoyalBlue}blue} = completed goal
    	\item {\color{ForestGreen} green} = in progress goal
    \end{itemize}

Goals that were completed or replaced at the last committee report have been removed

\begin{itemize}

\item By December 2019
\begin{itemize}
\item {\color{ForestGreen} write introductory thesis chapter explaining how my three papers (chemical space dimensionality, DBSCAN results on simulated data, and DBSCAN results on real data) all fit together}
\item {\color{RoyalBlue}finish paper describing application of DBSCAN to APOGEE data}
\item {\color{RoyalBlue} find external committee member for thesis defense}
\item {\color{ForestGreen} apply more focus to making connections for a potential industry position}
\end{itemize}
\item May 2020
\begin{itemize}
\item {complete any revisions to paper describing applications of DBSCAN to APOGE data}
\item {\color{ForestGreen} combine introduction with my publications to form a thesis}
\item {submit thesis to external examiner (no later than May 10)}
\item submit thesis to final oral exam committee and graduate administrator (no later than May 24 and ideally by May 1)
\end{itemize}
\item June 2020
\begin{itemize}
\item submit final thesis title to graduate administrator (no later than June 10)
\item ensure external examiner's thesis appraisal report is collected (no later than June 24) 
\end{itemize}
\item July 10 2020 - Defend Thesis
\end{itemize}
