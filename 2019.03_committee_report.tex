    \section*{Committee Report}
    
    The primary goal of my PhD work is to answer questions about the Milky Way's formation and evolution using chemical tagging. Since my last meeting, I have completed and submitted a paper demonstrating that it's possible to recover realistic simulated clusters with a density-based approach to clustering in chemical space.    

    \subsection*{Degree progress}

	My primary focus during the past six months has been finalizing and submitting a paper describing the results of applying DBSCAN (density based spatial clustering applications with noise - \citealt{Ester1996}) to simulated chemical data. This data emulates results from H-band spectroscopic survey APOGEE (Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment - \citealt{Majewski2017}), but in the paper we make predictions for other chemical surveys, like GALAH () and the Milky Way Mapper, a successor to APOGEE in SDSS-V (). We do this by assigning stars to birth clusters, giving stars from the same birth cluster the same chemistry. Cluster sizes are chosen according to a cluster mass function in accordance with observations.
	
	We tested the ability of DBSCAN  to recover these birth clusters using different kinds of chemical spaces, making a distinction between chemical spaces based on stellar spectra and those based on derived chemical abundances. In the case of the spectra, we showed that we can only do useful classification if we take steps to remove pixels that do not contribute chemical information (e.g. noise or continuum). We did this using a principal component analysis (PCA) reduction on the spectra \cite{bla}. We explored abundance spaces with a few different choices for observational uncertainties: those typical for APOGEE's pipeline \citep{Abolfathi2018}, those typical for the \texttt{astroNN} neural network \citep{Leung2018}, and those predicted as theoretical best recovery in \citep{Ting2016b}. When using the latter two choices for abundance uncertainties or the PCA-reduced spectra we showed that we recovered between 20\% and 60\% of our simulated birth clusters with a homogeneity of 0.7 (cluster members were 70\% the group found by DBSCAN) and a completeness of 0.7 (70\% of cluster members were in the group found by DBSCAN). 
	
	As a preliminary test of DBSCAN on real cluster data, we included real APOGEE measurements for members of open clusters as identified by the Open Cluster Chemical Abundances and Mapping survey (OCCAM -\citealt{Frinchaboy2003},\citealt{Donor2018}). Our strict quality cuts ensured each open cluster member had good measurements for each abundance, but reduced the number of members enough that we were not able to recover any known open clusters. We were however able to assess how the open clusters compare to our simulated birth clusters using a metric I will apply to clusters recovered in real data; the silhouette coefficient. This metric increases as a cluster becomes more distinct from its surroundings in chemical space. When examining our principal component chemical space, we found that the open clusters had a higher silhouette coefficient than our birth clusters. This might be due to the low membership of the open clusters causing them to appear more compact than they would truly be with additional members; however they need only be at least as compact as our simulated birth clusters to be recovered.
	
	My next steps will be to investigate combinations of elements for which our cuts on open clusters need not be so stringent, and to apply DBSCAN to observations. I have taken steps towards this by using DBSCAN on abundances derived by \texttt{astroNN}. While clusters can be recovered, they are fewer than expected given the sample size, and I do not successfully find any of the open clusters in the data set. However I continue to investigate what I have recovered, as well as how I may be able to work with even larger sets of observations.
	
	I was able to present some of the results described above at the Life and Times of the Milky Way conference in Shanghai in November.
    
    \subsection*{Upcoming work and anticipated challenges}
    
    Having only recently received the referee comments on my paper, my immediate future work will be updating my draft and submitting a response to the comments. However, now that I have taken the first steps towards applying my approach to real data, I am keen to continue exploring how DBSCAN recovered groups relate to birth clusters of stars. 
    
    As mentioned in previous reports, applying DBSCAN to observations will mean making choices about how to preprocess those observations, since a using Euclidean distance metric requires that each star have full chemical space information. I have mentioned in my main report that one way around this might be reducing the number of abundances considered; another would be to choose alternative ways to compute distance. For this reason I have begun working with Itamar Reis (Tel Aviv University) on doing classifications using Random Forest similarities \citep{Reis2019} to perform clustering.
    
    I am also presently developing a way to partition larger datasets into sensible sections so they can be classified with DBSCAN.
    
	
   
 
\section*{DBSCAN applied to real data: paper outline}

\textbf{This section still applies - change it or not?}
One of my main goals for this thesis is to apply DBSCAN to real data, making use of the abundances and the spectra as separate chemical spaces. Having already prepared a paper on expectations for DBSCAN results from simulated data, I will be free in this work to demonstrate what we can learn from the observations. The paper will primarily focus on presenting the largest groups found by DBSCAN in the observations, with special attention paid to known open and globular clusters as checks for successful chemical space recovery. I plan to investigate a range of DBSCAN parameters to find the best ones for cluster recovery according to the measures of success laid out in my paper on applications to synthetic data. Although there may not be enough open cluster data to measure the fraction of known clusters recovered, I can seed my simulated clusters into the real data to serve as the known clusters. I will also check internally for the robustness of the groups found by DBSCAN by investigating whether membership is consistent across a range of DBSCAN parameters and whether stars grouped with the same set of other stars in different chemical spaces (e.g. abundances vs spectra0> Once a robust set of clusters is found from the real data, I will investigate the spatial and Hertzsprung-Russell locations of the clustered stars with help from 2MASS \citep{Skrutskie2006} and Gaia \citep{GaiaCollaboration2016}. If an individual cluster is promising, I may also attempt isochrone fitting to determine cluster age \citep{Bressan2012}. In addition to potentially using simulated clusters to measure recovery fraction, I can also use the simulations to make qualitative and quantitative comparisons to the found clusters. For this work I plan to upgrade my simulations, improving the Galaxy's density profile and the treatment of radial migration when considering cluster sampling rate.
