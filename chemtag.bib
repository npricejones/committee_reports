@article{Ting2015,
abstract = {It is now well-established that the elemental abundance patterns of stars holds key clues not only to their formation but also to the assembly histories of galaxies. One of the most exciting possibilities is the use of stellar abundance patterns as "chemical tags" to identify stars that were born in the same molecular cloud. In this paper we assess the prospects of chemical tagging as a function of several key underlying parameters. We show that in the fiducial case of {\$}10{\^{}}4{\$} distinct cells in chemical space and {\$}10{\^{}}5-10{\^{}}6{\$} stars in the survey, one can expect to detect {\$}\backslashsim 10{\^{}}2-10{\^{}}3{\$} groups that are {\$}\backslashge 5\backslashsigma{\$} overdensities in the chemical space. However, we find that even very large overdensities in chemical space do not guarantee that the overdensity is due to a single set of stars from a common birth cloud. In fact, for our fiducial model parameters, the typical {\$}5\backslashsigma{\$} overdensity is comprised of stars from a wide range of clusters with the most dominant cluster contributing only 25{\%} of the stars. The most important factors limiting the identification of disrupted clusters via chemical tagging are the number of chemical cells in the chemical space and the survey sampling rate of the underlying stellar population. Both of these factors can be improved through strategic observational plans. While recovering individual clusters through chemical tagging may prove challenging, we show, in agreement with previous work, that different CMFs imprint different degrees of clumpiness in chemical space. These differences provide the opportunity to statistically reconstruct the slope and high mass cutoff of CMF and its evolution through cosmic time.},

@article{Frey2007,
abstract = {Clustering data by identifying a subset of representative examples is important for processing sensory signals and detecting patterns in data. Such "exemplars" can be found by randomly choosing an initial subset of data points and then iteratively refining it, but this works well only if that initial choice is close to a good solution. We devised a method called "affinity propagation," which takes as input measures of similarity between pairs of data points. Real-valued messages are exchanged between data points until a high-quality set of exemplars and corresponding clusters gradually emerges. We used affinity propagation to cluster images of faces, detect genes in microarray data, identify representative sentences in this manuscript, and identify cities that are efficiently accessed by airline travel. Affinity propagation found clusters with much lower error than other methods, and it did so in less than one-hundredth the amount of time.},
