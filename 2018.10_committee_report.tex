    \section*{Committee Report}
    
    The primary goal of my PhD work is to answer questions about the Milky Way's formation and evolution using chemical tagging. Since my last meeting, I have completed work for my paper on recovering clusters in simulated chemical space with a density based clustering algorithm.    

    \subsection*{Degree progress}

	Over the past six months, I have been focussed on improving my cluster finding on chemical space and finalizing results for publication. Most of my time has been spent working on my paper on measuring the success of cluster finding algorithms on realistic chemical spaces, and I have nearly completed the submission draft. The simulated chemical spaces in the paper emulate APOGEE \citep{Majewski2017} chemical data, but the methods are widely applicable. I now use both spectra and abundances as chemical spaces to search for clusters, and make modifications to both to improve cluster finding performance. In the case of abundances, I test cluster recovery for several different choices of measurement noise, ranging from the current abundance uncertainties quoted by APOGEE in \citealt{DR14} to the theoretical minimum uncertainties for abundances derived from APOGEE spectra \citep{Ting}.
	
	In my initial thesis proposal, I had suggested two rather simple statistics to measure the success of cluster recovery; the homogeneity and completeness of the recovered clusters. However a measurement of these quantities assumes that the true cluster membership is already known. While these statistics might measure the success of a clustering algorithm on my synthetic data, they would not be relevant when clustering on real data. One way around this problem is to make use of open cluster data, since these groups are similar to the clusters I generate, but their membership is known even in observed data. To quantify the success of the clustering algorithm, I measured the recovery fraction of the open clusters: the fraction of open clusters that were matched to a group found by my clustering algorithm with high homogeneity and completeness. Currently, there are not enough open cluster members to make this recovery fraction a viable statistic, but in future the recovery fraction will provide a way to measure success of clustering on real data. In particular, I plan to return to the recovery fraction once open cluster data is publicly released from the GALAH spectroscopic survey \citep{galah}.
    
    In addition to the rest of my work, I attended the Gaia Sprint in NYC, where I developed the beginning of the framework I will use to apply my clustering algorithm to real data. In particular, I focussed testing alternate methods of filling in gaps where observations were missing or untrustworthy. I presented my work on clustering finding in simulated chemical spaces at the Dark Energy Survey workshop on near-field cosmology at the Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics. I also applied and was accepted to the Life and Times of the Milky Way conference hosted by the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, where I will be giving a contributed talk on my upcoming paper.
  
    
    \subsection*{Upcoming work and Anticipated Challenges}
    
    My main focus before the next meeting will be submitting and responding to comments on my paper describing the success of my cluster-finding algorithm on simulated data. I will also be working on ways to make my simulation even more realistic, primarily by incorporating a better model for the Milky Way than the uniform disk. I plan to include this on a future paper that compares the results of these more detailed simulations with observations from the APOGEE and GALAH surveys.
    
	
   
 
\section*{Cluster-finding method paper outline}

The goal of my upcoming paper is to communicate what can be learned from a realistic chemical space from DBSCAN, in terms of cluster sizes and properties. Part of my work will be to explain the algorithm and the reasons it is useful for this scenario, as well as justifying my choices of parameters in terms of observed star clusters. I will also describe how I validate the results of DBSCAN's cluster finding, both in the case where the the true clusters are known (simulated data) and when they are not (simulated and observed data). Having justified my choice in algorithm, the main focus of the paper will be to explain what observational surveys may expect to learn from chemical tagging. In particular, the ability of a survey to observe chemical space clusters will depend on several factors. Some of these will be governed intrinsic physics, like the parameters of the CMF, the importance of radial migration and the star formation history. However some factors will be survey limited: the resolution of chemical space, the number of observed stars and the target population. For example, a survey of primarily disk stars will likely sample more clusters (with fewer members per cluster) than a similarly sized halo survey due to the difference in the overall population size. The resolution of chemical space is also a crucial in determining what can be learned from chemical tagging. Coarse resolution will lead to disparate clusters being merged in analysis, erasing detailed information about the star formation history. The paper will outline several examples of possible survey parameters and describe the number of clusters expected to be identified based on simulations with underlying cluster properties.
